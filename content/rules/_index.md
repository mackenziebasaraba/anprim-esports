Failure to comply with the rules will result in a permanent ban.

If you believe you've been unfairly banned contact an administrator at anprimesports@protonmail.com.

## General Rules

1. Tomfoolery is permitted within reason---don't be a dick.
1. Do not spam the chat.

## Build Rules

1. Ugly buildings are forbidden; blank rectangles will be carpet bombed by server staff.
1. Hate symbols outside of historic recreations are not allowed.
1. Do not recreate sites of genocide.
1. {{< abbr title="Not Safe For Work" >}}NSFW{{</abbr>}} content is not allowed.

## Farm Rules

1. Farms must be replanted or reset after use.
1. Automatic farms tend to be laggy; if players complain about lag turn them off.
1. Chunk loaders are illegal unless they require a player to be present within the area.

## Land Claims

1. Claim land within reason; build density is more interested than empty plains.

1. Do not claim large amounts of land within populated areas.
